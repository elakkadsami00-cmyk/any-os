##  State Management & Data Consistency

### The Hybrid State Model

The application uses a hybrid approach to state management, balancing the ephemeral nature of UI state with the need for data persistence.

1.  **React `useState`**: Used for all component-level, non-persistent UI state. This includes loading indicators, modal visibility, user input in forms, and the current state of an active chat or game. This state is volatile and is lost on a page refresh.

2.  **`localStorage` via Services**: Used as the single source of truth for all persistent data. The services (e.g., `studentDataService`, `chatHistoryService`) act as an abstraction layer. React components **never** interact with `localStorage` directly.

### Data Mutation Pattern

To ensure data consistency and prevent stale state, a strict data mutation pattern is followed throughout the application:

1.  **Fetch**: A component fetches the data it needs from a service in a `useEffect` hook.
    ```tsx
    // In some component
    useEffect(() => {
        const profiles = studentDataService.getStudentProfiles();
        setStudentProfiles(profiles);
    }, []);
    ```
2.  **Mutate**: A user action triggers a call to a service function that modifies the data in `localStorage`.
    ```tsx
    // In some component
    const handleAddIncident = (data) => {
        studentDataService.addIncidentToStudent(studentId, data);
        // ...
    };
    ```
3.  **Re-fetch/Signal Update**: The component that initiated the change signals to its parent (or re-fetches its own data) to get the fresh state from the service layer. This is often done via an `onUpdate` prop callback.
    ```tsx
    // Child component calls the prop after mutation
    const handleCompleteQuest = () => {
        studentDataService.updateQuestForStudent(...);
        props.onUpdate(); // Signal to parent
    }

    // Parent component provides the callback
    <QuestsView onUpdate={refreshStudentProfile} />
    ```
This simple but effective pattern ensures that the UI is always synchronized with the persistent state in `localStorage` without the need for a complex state management library.

## Component Deep Dive: `AdventureGame.tsx`

The `AdventureGame` component is one of the most complex in the application, orchestrating multiple asynchronous AI calls, managing a stateful game loop, and rendering dynamic content.

### State Management within the Game

The component uses several `useState` hooks to manage the game's lifecycle:

-   `nodes: AdventureNode[]`: An array of all completed and the current stage of the adventure. It is the primary record of the story so far.
-   `nextNode: AdventureNode | null`: Stores the prefetched next stage of the adventure, ready to be displayed.
-   `sceneVisuals: Record<number, string>`: A map of stage numbers to their generated image or video URLs.
-   `answers: { stage: number, isCorrect: boolean }[]`: A log of the student's performance.
-   `isLoadingInitial`, `isFetchingNext`: Loading states for the initial node and subsequent nodes, respectively.
-   `aiFeedback`, `isGeneratingFeedback`: Manages the AI-generated feedback after a user's answer.
-   `showNextButton`: Controls the visibility of the "Next Stage" button.

### The Asynchronous Game Loop & Prefetching

The game's progression relies on a clever prefetching strategy to minimize perceived latency for the student.

1.  **Initialization**: An initial `useEffect` calls `generateAdventureInitialNode` to get the first stage. Once received, it's added to the `nodes` state.
2.  **Trigger Prefetch**: A second `useEffect` hook is triggered whenever the `nodes` array changes. This means as soon as a new stage is added, the component immediately calls `generateAdventureNextNode` in the background.
    -   The prompt for this call includes the entire history of `nodes` and `answers`, allowing the AI to generate a contextually and adaptively relevant next stage.
3.  **Store Prefetched Node**: The result from `generateAdventureNextNode` is stored in the `nextNode` state, and its visual is fetched via `fetchVisual`. The UI does **not** yet display this node.
4.  **User Progression**: When the student completes the current stage's interaction and clicks "Next Stage," the `handleNext` function is called. It simply moves the node from `nextNode` into the `nodes` array.
5.  **Loop**: This change to the `nodes` array re-triggers the `useEffect` from step 2, and the cycle continues, always staying one step ahead of the user.

This "fetch-ahead" mechanism is crucial for making the AI-driven narrative feel responsive and seamless.

### Interaction & Feedback Flow

1.  **Render Interaction**: The `renderInteraction` function checks the `type` of the current node's `interaction` object and renders the appropriate React component (e.g., `<FillInTheBlankInteraction />`).
2.  **User Answer**: The interactive widget captures the user's answer and calls its `onComplete` prop, passing up whether the answer was correct and a string representation of the answer.
3.  **Feedback Generation**: `handleInteractionComplete` is triggered. It updates the `answers` state, and then immediately calls `geminiService.generateAdventureFeedback`. This prompt is heavily persona-driven, instructing the AI to respond in character as the student's chosen Hero.
4.  **Stream Feedback**: The feedback is streamed into the `aiFeedback` state, providing an immediate, character-driven response to the student's action.
5.  **Enable Progression**: Once the feedback stream is complete, `showNextButton` is set to `true`, allowing the student to proceed to the next stage, which has already been prefetched.

## üîê Security, Privacy, and Performance

### Privacy Model In-Depth

-   **Data Boundary**: The fundamental privacy guarantee is that student data (profiles, incidents, performance) **never leaves the browser**. This data is only used client-side to construct prompts for the Gemini API.
-   **Implications**:
    -   **Data Portability**: Data is inherently tied to a specific browser on a specific device. Clearing browser cache will delete all data.
    -   **No Cross-Device Sync**: A student's progress on a school computer will not be available on a home computer.
    -   **User Consent**: The application relies on the browser's built-in mechanisms for permissions like microphone access. No data is captured without explicit user consent.

### API Key Management

-   **Standard Flow**: The primary mechanism for API key access is through the `process.env.API_KEY` environment variable, which is assumed to be configured in the execution environment. The `GoogleGenAI` instance is initialized with this key.
-   **Special Case for Veo**: The Veo model for video generation has specific requirements. The `geminiService` includes a `handleVeoApiKey` helper function that uses the `window.aistudio` object provided by the execution environment. It checks `hasSelectedApiKey()` and, if necessary, calls `openSelectKey()` to prompt the user. A new `GoogleGenAI` instance is created just before the `generateVideos` call to ensure it uses the most recently selected key.

### Performance Considerations

-   **AI Latency**: API calls to generative models are inherently slower than traditional API calls. The application uses several strategies to manage this:
    -   **Streaming**: All chat interfaces stream responses chunk-by-chunk, displaying text as it's generated.
    -   **Loading Indicators**: Detailed loading messages (e.g., "Drafting learning objectives...") manage user expectations during longer generation tasks.
    -   **Prefetching**: As seen in the `AdventureGame`, fetching the next piece of content in the background while the user interacts with the current content.
-   **Client-Side Processing**:
    -   **PDF Parsing**: The `utils/pdfParser.ts` uses `pdf.js` with web workers to parse PDF files without freezing the main UI thread. A progress callback updates the UI to show parsing status.
    -   **Asset Generation**: Generating large PDFs (`jspdf`) or ZIP files (`jszip`) can be CPU-intensive. These actions are triggered by explicit user clicks and show loading states to indicate that processing is underway.

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Resilience

The application is designed to handle common failures gracefully.

### API and Network Errors
-   All calls within `geminiService.ts` are wrapped in `try...catch` blocks.
-   If an API call fails, the service throws an error or returns a user-friendly error message.
-   UI components catch these errors and update their state (e.g., `setError('An error occurred...')`) to display an alert to the user instead of crashing.

### Media Generation Failures
-   Generating images or videos can fail. The `AdventureGame` manages this with the `visualErrors` state. If `fetchVisual` fails for a given stage, it sets `visualErrors[stage] = true`. The UI then renders an error message in place of the visual, allowing the adventure to continue without interruption.
-   The video generation flow in `geminiService` includes a `try...catch` block around the polling operation (`getVideosOperation`). If the operation fails or the user's API key is invalid, it throws a specific, user-friendly error that is displayed in the UI.

### AI Response Parsing Errors
-   While `responseSchema` makes JSON output highly reliable, errors can still occur. The `JSON.parse()` calls in `geminiService.ts` are implicitly part of the `try...catch` block. If the AI returns malformed JSON, the `catch` block will be triggered, and the function will throw an error, which is then handled by the calling component.
-   The `interactiveParser.ts` is designed to be resilient. If it fails to parse a widget format, it treats the text as plain text, ensuring the application does not crash due to an unexpected AI response format.

## üß™ Testing Strategy

While no tests are included in the codebase, here is the recommended strategy for testing an AI-native application like this.

### Unit & Service Tests
-   **Target**: Utility functions (`interactiveParser.ts`) and data services (`studentDataService.ts`, `chatHistoryService.ts`).
-   **Tools**: `vitest` or `jest`.
-   **Method**:
    -   For `interactiveParser`, provide a variety of input strings and assert that the output `ParsedContent[]` array is correct.
    -   For data services, mock `localStorage` to test that `get`, `add`, `update`, and `delete` functions correctly manipulate the stored data.

### Component Tests
-   **Target**: Individual React components.
-   **Tools**: `React Testing Library`.
-   **Method**:
    -   **Crucially, mock the `geminiService` module.** Tests should not make real API calls.
    -   For a component like `LessonPlannerView`, a test would be:
        1.  Render the component.
        2.  Mock `geminiService.generateLessonPlan` to return a specific, predefined `LessonPlan` object.
        3.  Simulate a form submission.
        4.  Assert that the component updates to display the mocked lesson plan data correctly.
    -   This approach tests the component's rendering and state logic in isolation from the non-deterministic AI.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
-   **Target**: User flows through the entire application.
-   **Tools**: `Cypress` or `Playwright`.
-   **Method**:
    -   E2E tests can be run against a live API, but this is slow, costly, and non-deterministic.
    -   A better approach is to use the testing tool's network interception features to stub the Gemini API endpoint.
    -   When the application makes a `fetch` request to the AI, the E2E test intercepts it and returns a predefined, streamed, or JSON response.
    -   This allows for testing complex flows (like completing an entire Adventure Game) in a fast, reliable, and repeatable manner.
